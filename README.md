1.) Explain super() in the context of inheritance.
• super is used to refer immediate parent 
class instance variable. We can use super 
keyword to access the data member or field 
of parent class. It is used if parent class and 
child class have same fields
2.) Describe the file-handling system.
• A file management system is used for file 
maintenance (or management) operations. 
It is is a type of software that manages data 
files in a computer system. A file 
management system has limited capabilities 
and is designed to manage individual or 
group files, such as special office documents 
and records
3.) In Python, explain multiple inheritance.
• A class can be derived from more than one 
base class in Python, similar to C++. This is 
called multiple inheritance. In multiple 
inheritance, the features of all the base 
classes are inherited into the derived class. 
The syntax for multiple inheritance is similar 
to single inheritance.
4.) Write the MySQL query syntax for INSERT, 
UPDATE, and DROP.
• MySQL server is a open-source relational 
database management system which is a 
major support for web based applications. 
Databases and related tables are the main 
component of many websites and 
applications as the data is stored and 
exchanged over the web. Even all social 
networking websites mainly Facebook, 
Twitter, and Google depends on MySQL 
data which are designed and optimized for 
such purpose. For all these reasons, MySQL 
server becomes the default choice for web 
applications
• INSERT:-
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
• UPDATE:- UPDATE table_name SET field1 = 
new-value1, field2 = new-value2 [WHERE 
Clause]
• Drop :- DROP [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF 
EXISTS] table_name [, table_name] 
[RESTRICT | CASCADE];
5.) Describe MongoDB's features.
• It contains heterogeneous data. It provides 
high performance, availability, scalability. It 
supports Geospatial efficiently. It is a 
document oriented database and the data is 
stored in BSON documents. It also supports 
multiple document ACID transition(string 
from MongoDB 4.0)
